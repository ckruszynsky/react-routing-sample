# Absolute vs Relative Paths

## Absolute Paths

if you enter to="/some-path" or to="some-path", that's an absolute
path.

which will lead to :
example.com/some-path

## Relative Paths

if you want to use a relative path; you neeed to use the props.match.url property
to append the relative url to your path
